        Who I am.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm junior at UC Berkeley double majoring in Computer Science and
        Integrative Biology. I am super interested in the intersection of
        computer science and healthcare/medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never really thought about majoring in Computer Science before Cal
        until I took my first programming class and absolutely fell in love and
        realized how powerful of a tool it is and how applicable it is to
        biology, healthcare, and research.

      <h2>
        What I've done.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm super passionate about discovery and I have both a research
        background in wet and dry lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my wet lab experience, I led a team of PhD and Masters students in

          Pharmacy

        where I looked at the combination of the effect of endocrine disruptors
        on spermatogonia and testicular macrophage cells

        I've also worked in a startup where we tested different chemical
        compounds to see which impaired the mitochondria for spermatogonia in

        In my dry lab experience, I worked with a team to develop a

        What I like to do in my free time.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I love poetry so I like to write poetry to release my creative
        expression. Recently a hobby that I picked up during quarantine is
        cooking. My favorite thing to make is meatless meatballs.
